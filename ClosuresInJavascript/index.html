    <h2>Closures In Javascript</h2>

    <p>
This code demonstrates the use of closures in JavaScript by creating a function `multiply` that returns another function.
 The inner function has access to the outer function's variable `x`, allowing it to remember the value of `x` even after the outer function has finished executing. This is a key feature of closures in JavaScript.
 The inner function can be called multiple times with different values of `y`, and it will always have access to the `x` value that was passed when the outer function was called.
